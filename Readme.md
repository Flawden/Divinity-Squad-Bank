# Divinity Squad Bank
## Made by Flawden

A banking application for issuing loans, debit and credit cards, obtaining information on accounts by bank customers.

## Features 

- Issuance of loans and credit cards for them.
- Opening debit cards, for keeping money in the bank
- Displaying basic information about customers and their accounts with thymeleaf
- Registration of new users in the system, their removal and editing

The banking system is easy to use. The main advantage of this application is the absence of Spring boot, which allows you to look at the Spring MVC configuration with your own eyes and see what Spring boot left behind the scenes.
